# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Engineer with a passion for coding. I have industry experience in both low level (bare metal) and high level (web and mobile app) software development. In my spare time I love figuring out to what extent I can make my home "smarter".

## Professional Info
Currently I'm the Director of a Systems Integration company called SAPHI.

## Coding Info
I spend most of my days jumping between LabVIEW, IEC 61131-9 and JavaScript/TypeScript. Starting to play with Deno.js.
